# Tensorflow Sequences Time Series And Prediction

In this fourth course, you will learn how to build time series models in TensorFlow. You’ll first implement best practices to prepare time series data. You’ll also explore how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data


## Where There Are Look At Time Series

## Time Series 

It is order of sequence of values that are usuelly equaly space of time.

## Univariate Time Series

## What Kind Of Thing Can We Do With Time Series

1. Prediction Of The Forecasting Base of the data.

2. Projection back on to the time, this proces is call **Imputation**

3. How is your data base on others data

4. Time Series can be use to detected anormaly: for exapmple on **web site log** we can to see what is the problem.

1. Other option is to analyze **time series** to spot of find a pattern what generate the serie itself.
